 * Class lookup for soft integrations.

 * `Class.forName(name)` uses *our* classloader, which only sees another plugin's classes when
 * Paper actually joined it to our classpath. That link is not guaranteed: on a real server the
 * declared dependencies formed a cycle
 * (`inmc-monsters -> MMOItems -> nightcore -> ItemsAdder -> nightcore`), Paper broke it by dropping
 * one of our edges, and the ItemsAdder hook died with a ClassNotFoundException even though the
 * class was sitting right there in the jar.
 *
 * Going through the owning plugin's own classloader removes the dependency on load order and
 * on classpath joining entirely.
